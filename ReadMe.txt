Simple 1st version.  Steps to use:

*You must unzip this into (d2 directory)/StashTool*

(1) Run buildCharacterData.vbs before you want to search.  Just double click and it takes a second or two to run.
(2) Now open stashTool.html in your web browser
(3) Punch in a keyword.  It will search the item name, and every name/value from stats as well.

You can search for "Mara", "Crossbow", "Lightning Skills", "Lightning Resistance", etc.

Some stat names are altered, planning to work on a mapping file to convert them to normal names people know.  For example crush is crushing blow.
